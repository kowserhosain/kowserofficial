What's Shopify? 
Shopify is a complete commerce platform that lets you start, grow, and manage a business. 
Shopify moxie and leadership in commerce come from the guests of millions of merchandisers on the Shopify platform. Their successes allow us to read and make the right features to not only power commerce moment but to help shape and define what the assiduity looks like hereafter. 
How does Shopify work? 
Shopify unifies all of your commerce onto a single platform. With Shopify, merchandisers can make and customize an online store and vend in multiple places, including web, mobile, in-person, slip up- and- mortar locales, and pop-up shops and across multiple channels from social media to online commerce. 
Shopify is fully pall- grounded and hosted, which means you can pierce it from any connected compatible device and we’ll handle software and garçon upgrades and conservation for you. This gives you the inflexibility to pierce and run your business from anywhere with an internet connection. 
On any given day, a commerce business requires an array of tools to manage products, force, payments, and shipping — and they spend a lot of time and plutocrats suturing the distant systems and data together. Shopify groups those technologies together and ensures that you can fluently pierce and integrate any other business tools you need to make Shopify work for your business. 
Think of Shopify’s products as layers you can choose from to make the right mound for your business.
